#The dippid-sender
The simulation of input is done by interference patterns of multiple sin waves. It is not truly random, since they will be the same each time and repeat after a certain period. 

#The game ShootToStop
Players move by tilting the input device on the x axis. 
They shoot by pressing button 1.
They have three lives.
Players lose a live by getting hit by an enemy or by letting an enemy fall behind of screen. The enemies are spawned randomly at the upper end of the scene and fly towards a random point at the bottom of the screen.
They gain points the longer they stay alive(one point per frame) and by shooting enemies(200 points), but loos points each time they shoot(10 points).
The points and lives are displayed at the edges of the screen.
When the player has no lives left the game closes and prints the final points in the terminal.

#The assets.
The Background art was created by creating a street scene with stable diffusion and eddeting it in Krita to fit the needs of the game.
The Character animation was created by designing the character with stable diffusion, modeling a 3d Model based on the design and projecting the design onto it, with aditional changes. The Animation data is from mixamo.
