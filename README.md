Players lose a life by getting hit by an enemy or by letting an enemy fall behind the screen. The enemies are spawned randomly at the upper end of the scene and fly towards a random point at the bottom of the screen.
They gain points the longer they stay alive (one point per frame) and by shooting enemies (200 points), but lose points each time they shoot (10 points).
The points and lives are displayed at the edges of the screen.
When the player has no lives left, the game closes and prints the final points on the terminal.
